Brain Tumor Detection Using CNN
A CNN-based brain tumor detection project using MRI images.

This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based system for detecting brain tumors from MRI images. It uses a pre-trained deep learning model to classify images into four categories:

Glioma Tumor
Meningioma Tumor
Pituitary Tumor
No Tumor
The goal of this project is to provide a simple and easy-to-use tool for researchers, students, and developers to test brain MRI images for tumor detection using deep learning.

This repository includes:

The pre-trained CNN model (brain_tumor_detection_model.h5)
A Python script for loading the model and making predictions
Instructions for running the code and testing with your own MRI images
Note: The original training dataset is not included due to size restrictions. You can provide your own MRI images for testing.
